          <h3>A Letter From Arista</h3>
            <p class="lead">Hello and welcome to the Monarchy! My name is Arista Corral, and I want to personally congratulate you for taking the right steps and choosing Pursuit of Curls as a guide for your curly hair expedition. Whether you’ve been in the community for years, or you are just now stepping into your journey, I am more than happy to help!</p>


            <p>My passion for curly and textured hair, paired with my extensive training and education, makes me the perfect candidate to become your personal Curl Artist. The health and well being of your curly hair is important to you, and I want it to be important to me too. I believe in growth of skill and education and I am working to find my spot to do my part in the natural hair community.</p>


            <p>I have always had an infatuation for hair, but if you would have told me in grade school that I was going to be a hairdresser I would not believe you. Even though I had a slight unhealthy obsession of touching my classmates hair in the middle of class, I hated doing my own hair. My mom kept my hair chemically relaxed since I was 6 years old and I did not enjoy my flat limp hair.</p>

            <p>In 2013 I attended the Tallahassee Aveda Institute. I was attracted to their lifestyle and understanding of not only hair, but their leadership in the world of beauty. After graduating and receiving my license, I remained with Aveda for 5 years. In my eyes, they were making progress with hair textures, but not at the speed that I expected. In 2019 I joined a different salon, one where I was able to decide my own growth and I adapted to the title as a Curl Specialist.</p>

            <p>In my journey to find what makes hair tick, I saw the demand for naturally curly hair. I was finding that, just like with Aveda, other hair platforms were experiencing a shortage in knowledge on more textured hair. That started my passion for finding the missing information and I continue to pursue any knowledge I can find (hence where I got my name). I had other curl artists that I’ve looked up to and learned from over the years, and I decided that it was about time for me to put out there my own knowledge for curly hair.</p>

            <p>Thank you for joining me in my journey in pursuit of curls. I look forward to our voyage together!</p>
