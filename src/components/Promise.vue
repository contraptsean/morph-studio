      <br />Hair is an important part of our culture – a part of our roots. It’s not simply about the aesthetic, it’s a ritual, and its for everyone.</li>
      <li><strong>Health:</strong>
      <br />While the journey to healthy hair is unique to each person’s hair texture, it shouldn’t have to be difficult, or inconvenient. On the contrary, it should be enjoyable.</li>
      <li><strong>Style:</strong>
      <br />We know that time is money. Our signature straightening method guarantees to get you in, get styled, and get going.</li>
